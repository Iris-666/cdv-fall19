### Critical Data & Visualization Fall 2019

Welcome! This page will be filled with material and links throughout the Semester. I recommend you **bookmark it now**.

#### first things first (coding foundation)

We will spend 50% of our time coding. Having a shared foundation for this is **extremely important**. I will always be there to support and assist you with problems you encounter. For now, please work your way through [Coding Foundation: Setup and Exercises](coding-foundation]) and submit your work in the end.

Spoiler: We will all be using GitHub this semester. Yay!

Hi,
welcome to the Critical Data & Visualization class. Please follow the following steps. First, we will set up your work environment for this semester, and then run you through a little JavaScript exercise. In the end, I will show you how to submit things (assignments, poems, memes, etc.) to be shared with me & the rest of the students.

## Chrome Browser

## Text Editor

## GitHub Student Account

## Fork the class repo

## Atom Packages

## Clone the repo through Atom

## Coding exercise



## Submitting things (in this case, your coding exercise)










<!--##Create a space-->

<!--To start off, please create a directory structure fo everything we will do this semester. Choose a place on your computer that you don't expect to change later on. -->

<!--Create the directories like this:-->

<!--```-->
<!--cdv-->
<!--├── coding-foundation-->
<!--│   └── page1-->
<!--├── lab1-->
<!--│   ├── page1-->
<!--│   └── page2-->
<!--└── lab2-->
<!--```-->

<!--##Text editor-->

<!--In this class we will be using the [Atom Text Editor](https://atom.io) to write code. Unless you feel strongly about a different one, I recommend using the same. Please download it if you don't have it already. -->

<!--##Build an html page-->

<!--In `cdv/coding-foundation/page1`, build a simple html page. Make sure to add some element and some styling. If you want, write some JavaScript (more will follow later).-->

<!--I recommend structuring the page like thisi:-->


<!--```-->
<!--cdv-->
<!--├── coding-foundation-->
<!--│   └── page1-->
<!--│       ├── css-->
<!--│       │   └── styles.css-->
<!--│       ├── index.html-->
<!--│       └── js-->
<!--│           └── myscript.js-->
<!--└── ...-->
<!--```-->

<!--##Serving your website-->

<!--As you were working on the page, how did you see it? If you opened it with you browser, chances are it says something like `file://...` or `/Users/your-name/...` in the URL bar, does it?-->
<!--It this class, we will always be serving the pages we are working on via a "localhost server". If you have never heard of this before, read up on it for 20 minutes (but no longer). The easiest way to use a localhost for our pruposes is an package we can download for atom. It's called *atom-live-server*; please find out how to install and use it, this will be a must-know.-->


<!--##Chrome Developer Tools-->

<!--Unless you feel strongly for a different browser, please use Google Chrome for class. We will be using the Chrome Developer tools all the time. Make yourself familiar by reading the [Introduction](https://www.bitdegree.org/learn/chrome-developer-tools) and chapters about [Elements](https://www.bitdegree.org/learn/inspect-element) and the [JavaScript Console](https://www.bitdegree.org/learn/javascript-console) on this [page](https://www.bitdegree.org/learn/chrome-developer-tools).-->
